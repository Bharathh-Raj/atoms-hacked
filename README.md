From the perspective of a person who tries to become genius;

An average human mind takes input every minute from the physical world by the sense. As we grow year by year, we gain a lot of knowledge from our surroundings.
From the Great Homosapien to the contemporary people had created and defined a fine modifiable structure of worldview that can be perceived by us. We are taking that structure and using it very unknowingly every day. Newton’s quote goes like this, “ If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants”

Wondering why the above passage has serious talk and thoughts. I am also wondering why did I write that para? This above para indicates we(i) tend to be knowledgeable person from the reader’s perspective. Of course, we have a brain and that brain can process the field of our surroundings. We all know that a human as a species want to be a fully optimized and sophisticated life where we can swim in a pool without any clothes on. I mean we want a pressure-free life. 

And we are searching for it in every possible way for that life. One of the way, An elongated calculator where we can process some of our work by giving input and getting the output. I mentioned some of our work, not everything. I know a genius wants a never-ending definition. But, you know the bloody computer has only a limited number of storage and processing unit ( unless it scales itself ).
